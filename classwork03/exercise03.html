  <h2>Lyrics</h2>

  <p class="verse treb bold gold mlr2">
    I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me<br>
    Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me<br>
    Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me<br>
    You know how I like it when you lovin' on me<br>
    I don't wanna die for them to miss me<br>
    Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me<br>
    Hope I got some brothers that outlive me<br>
    They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me<br>
  </p>

  <p class="chorus treb bold italic gold mlr4">
    God's plan, God's plan
    I hold back, sometimes, I won't, yeah<br>
    I feel good, sometimes, I don't (Ayy, don't)<br>
    I finessed down Weston Road (Ayy, 'nessed)<br>
    Might go down a G-O-D (Yeah, wait)<br>
    I go hard on Southside G (Yeah, wait)<br>
    I make sure that north-side eat<br>
    And still
  </p>
